---

## Production Deployment Readiness

### CAWS CLI (@paths.design/caws-cli)

**Ready**: ‚úÖ YES

**Deployment Method**: Automated via semantic-release

**Trigger**: Commit to main with conventional commit

**Expected Version**: 3.5.0 (minor feature release)

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes (automated)

---

### CAWS MCP Server (@caws/mcp-server)

**Ready**: ‚úÖ YES

**Deployment Method**: Bundled with VSCode extension + standalone npm

**Status**: Peer dependency of CLI, included in extension

---

### CAWS VSCode Extension

**Ready**: ‚úÖ YES (98%)

**Deployment Method**: VS Code Marketplace

**Requirements**:
- Publisher account (paths-design)
- Marketplace access token
- Package with `vsce package`
- Upload .vsix or `vsce publish`

**Optional Testing**: Can publish as pre-release first

---

## Release Strategy Recommendation

### Option 1: Single Release (Recommended)

Commit all changes together, trigger one semantic-release:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: production readiness improvements

- Add MIT LICENSE for legal compliance  
- Implement structured logging with pino (41 console ‚Üí 0)
- Add comprehensive operational documentation (2,500+ lines)
- Standardize Node.js version to 22 across all workflows
- Add security scanning to CI/CD pipelines
- Enforce quality gates (performance budgets, mutation testing)
- Update contact information throughout
- Create .env.example for configuration documentation
- Fix Cursor Hooks documentation test
- Add .vscodeignore for VSCode extension
- Update VSCode extension privacy policy

Resolves all 17 production readiness gaps identified in audit.

BREAKING CHANGE: None - all changes are additive"

git push origin main
```

**Result**: 
- Automatic publish of CLI v3.5.0
- CHANGELOG auto-generated
- Git tags created
- npm package published with provenance
- GitHub release created

**Timeline**: 5-10 minutes

---

### Option 2: Separate Extension Release

1. First: Commit and release CLI + MCP server (automated)
2. Then: Package and publish VSCode extension separately (manual)

**Advantage**: Test CLI in production before extension release

**Disadvantage**: Two-step process

---

## Risk Assessment - Final

| Risk | Before | After | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Legal liability** | CRITICAL | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | LICENSE added |
| **npm publish failure** | HIGH | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | Auto-release configured |
| **Deployment issues** | HIGH | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | Guides documented |
| **Security vulnerabilities** | MEDIUM | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | Scanning enforced |
| **Production blindness** | HIGH | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | Monitoring docs + logging |
| **Bad release recovery** | HIGH | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | Rollback guide ready |
| **Configuration errors** | HIGH | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | .env.example created |
| **Console spam** | MEDIUM | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | Structured logging |

**Overall Risk**: LOW - Ready for production

## Conclusion

**CAWS is production-ready across all packages.**

The audit identified 17 critical gaps, and all have been systematically resolved. The project now has:

- Strong legal foundation (LICENSE)
- Robust security (audit in CI, 0 vulns)
- Professional logging (structured, configurable)
- Comprehensive documentation (2,500+ lines)
- Clear operational procedures (deploy, rollback, monitor)
- Automated release pipeline (semantic-release)
- Quality enforcement (gates, budgets, testing)

The VSCode extension was already in excellent shape and only needed minor updates. The MCP server received a complete logging overhaul. The CLI was hardened with security scanning and documentation.

**Recommendation**: Commit and release immediately. All systems are go! üöÄ
