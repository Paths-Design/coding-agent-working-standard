justification: |
  Major UX improvements require extensive changes across multiple components:
  - CLI restructure with subcommands
  - New provenance dashboard and visualization
  - Git hooks integration
  - Documentation updates
  - Contract tests for new functionality
  
  This architectural refactor improves user experience significantly
  while maintaining backward compatibility.
