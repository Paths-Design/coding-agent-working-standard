# CAWS — Agent Quick Reference (v11)

**Agent quickstart for working in CAWS-managed projects on the v11 substrate.**

## Read this first

The v11 cutover is complete. `main` runs the v11 surface (kernel/store/shell architecture, A1 posture). The doctrine source is [`docs/architecture/caws-vnext-command-surface.md`](docs/architecture/caws-vnext-command-surface.md). When this doc and the doctrine doc disagree, the doctrine doc wins.

**The v11 line ships fourteen top-level commands/groups** (plus the auto-generated `help`): the governed core plus `specs`, `worktree`, `events`, `agents`, `message`, and `prepush`. Commands removed in v11.0 and not planned to return (`validate`, `verify-acs`, `evaluate`, `iterate`, `diagnose`, `burnup`, `provenance`, `hooks`, `scaffold`, `mode`, `tutorial`, `plan`, `workflow`, `quality-monitor`, `tool`, `test-analysis`, `templates`, `sidecar`) will fail if invoked. `caws agents list/show` **ship in v11.1** (liveness substrate). `caws message send/poll` is a directed message channel, not authority. `caws prepush` is the governed pre-push range check (MULTI-AGENT-PUSH-RANGE-GUARD-001): it classifies the outgoing commit range and refuses commits not attributable to the current slice; it does NOT run `git push`. Only `caws session` and `caws parallel` are deferred (v11.3+); bridge claims and lease-backed *authority* are the v11.2 plan.

**Migrating from v10.2?** Read [`docs/migration-v10-to-v11.md`](docs/migration-v10-to-v11.md) before upgrading. It classifies every v10.2 command (Replaced / Renamed / Removed-no-replacement / Deferred) and includes a rollback one-liner. v11 is not a drop-in replacement for every v10.2 workflow.

## v11 command surface

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `caws init` | Bootstrap canonical `.caws/` state. Idempotent. Refuses legacy single-spec residue. No `--force`. |
| `caws doctor` | Drift detection over `.caws/` state. Exits 0 (clean) / 1 (findings or load errors) / 2 (composition failure). |
| `caws status` | Read-only dashboard: project, current context, claim, doctor findings. Never mutates `.caws/`. |
| `caws scope show / check / contention` | Explain scope, enforce scope, or report cross-worktree path contention. |
| `caws claim [--takeover]` | Surface or take ownership of the current worktree. Writes `prior_owners` audit on takeover. |
| `caws gates run --spec <id>` | Run policy-driven quality gates. Appends one `gate_evaluated` event per declared gate. |
| `caws evidence record --type <kind> --spec <id> --data <json>` | Append a typed evidence event (`test` / `gate` / `ac`). |
| `caws waiver create / list / show / revoke` | Manage waiver records. Singular surface — no plural alias. |
| `caws reprieve grant / show / revoke / list` | Session-scoped guard reprieve: skip a PreToolUse guard for ONE session until expiry. Replaces commenting a guard out of the dispatcher HANDLERS array. See [Reprieves](#reprieves). |
| `caws events migrate / rotate / verify-archive` | Maintenance for the hash-chained `.caws/events.jsonl`. |
| `caws specs create / list / show / recover / retire-draft / activate / amend-scope / close / archive / prune-archive / migrate / validate` | Manage spec lifecycle. Specs live at `.caws/specs/<id>.yaml`. Batch archive supports `--status closed`, `--include`, `--exclude`, and `--apply`. |
| `caws worktree create / list / bind / destroy / merge / repair-sparse / repair / migrate-registry` | Manage CAWS worktrees bound to active specs (`repair` prunes ghost registry entries + clears dead spec→worktree bindings; `repair-sparse` restores the `.caws/specs` sparse-checkout invariant). |
| `caws agents register / heartbeat / stop / list / show / prune` | Agent-liveness substrate (`.caws/leases/`). Operational cache only — never authority. |
| `caws message send / poll` | Directed inter-agent message channel over `.caws/messages.jsonl`. Not authority; verify claims before acting. |
| `caws prepush [--base <ref>] [--ack <sha>]` | Governed pre-push range check. Diagnose/decide only — does NOT run `git push`. |

Run `caws <group> --help` for full options and flag details.

## Specs in v11

- Specs live at `.caws/specs/<id>.yaml`. There is no project-level `working-spec.yaml`.
- The v11 line ships `caws specs create/list/show/recover/retire-draft/activate/amend-scope/close/archive/prune-archive/migrate/validate`. Create with `caws specs create <id> --title "..." --mode <feature|refactor|fix|doc|chore> --risk-tier <1|2|3>`, then edit the generated YAML. See existing specs in `.caws/specs/` for the shape.
- v11 does **not** ship `caws validate` (removed in v11.0, not returning). Validation happens via `caws doctor` (drift / structure) and `caws gates run --spec <id>` (policy / quality).
- Acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format.
- A spec's `scope.in` / `scope.out` defines what files an agent may touch. `caws scope check <path>` enforces it.

## Your contract with v11 CAWS

**You MUST:**

- Author a spec in `.caws/specs/<id>.yaml` for every unit of work.
- Stay within the spec's `scope.in` boundaries — verify with `caws scope check <path>`.
- Run `caws doctor` and `caws gates run --spec <id>` before declaring work complete.
- Use `caws waiver create` (singular) to legitimately bypass a gate, with an expiry, an approver, and a reason.
- Surface ownership with `caws claim` before mutating shared state in a worktree.
- Treat `caws status` as observability — never write to `.caws/` directly except through CLI commands.

**You MUST NOT:**

- Invoke removed commands (see list above) — they are gone.
- Edit `.caws/working-spec.yaml`, `.caws/events.jsonl`, `.caws/policy.yaml`, or other governed state by hand. Use the CLI.
- Hand-edit `change_budget` keys in spec YAML to make a gate pass — create a waiver instead.
- Take over a worktree owned by another session (`caws claim --takeover`) without explicit user authorization.
- Create shadow files (`*-enhanced.*`, `*-final.*`, `*-v2.*`, `*-copy.*`) — edit canonical files in place.

## Quick start (project setup)

```bash
git init my-project && cd my-project
caws init                                  # idempotent; refuses legacy residue
```

`caws init` creates:

```
.caws/
  specs/                  # per-feature specs (.caws/specs/<id>.yaml)
  waivers/                # waiver records (.caws/waivers/<id>.yaml)
  policy.yaml             # gate block/warn/skip policy
  worktrees.json          # worktree registry
  agents.json             # agent session registry
  # events.jsonl is created on first append; never required at rest.
```

If `.caws/working-spec.yaml` exists, `caws init` refuses. Migrate that file into per-feature `.caws/specs/<id>.yaml` first — or do the migration on `caws-cli@10.2.x` and then upgrade.

## Daily agent workflow

```bash
# 1. Author a spec for your work
caws specs create FEAT-1 --title "Short title" --mode feature --risk-tier 3
$EDITOR .caws/specs/FEAT-1.yaml          # fill in scope / invariants / acceptance

# 2. Verify scope/structure
caws doctor
caws scope show src/foo.ts                 # explain the scope decision
caws scope check src/foo.ts                # enforce; exits 1 if refused

# 3. Implement, run tests, then evaluate gates
caws gates run --spec FEAT-1               # policy decides block/warn/skip

# 4. Record typed evidence (test results, AC closures)
caws evidence record --type test --spec FEAT-1 \
  --data '{"name":"unit","status":"pass"}'
caws evidence record --type ac --spec FEAT-1 \
  --data '{"id":"A1","status":"satisfied"}'

# 5. Re-check
caws doctor
caws status
```

## Worktree-based parallel agent work

When multiple agents work on the same project, each agent **must** work in its own git worktree. CAWS's model is to **partition authority, not add channels between agents**: one spec + one bound worktree per agent, scope enforced from `scope.in`/`scope.out`, ownership in `.caws/worktrees.json`. There is no `caws parallel setup` (deferred to v11.3+) — loop `caws worktree create` per spec.

```bash
# Create an isolated worktree bound to your spec (writes the binding atomically,
# emits worktree_created + worktree_bound)
caws worktree create wt-auth --spec FEAT-AUTH
cd .caws/worktrees/wt-auth

# Surface the claim and see who else is live
caws claim                                 # prints owner; exits 0 if you own it
caws status                                # Agents panel: other live sessions
caws agents list                           # active / stale / stopped sessions

# When done: merge (auto-closes the bound spec) and destroy
caws worktree merge wt-auth
caws worktree destroy wt-auth
```

### Foreign-claim soft-block

`caws claim`, `caws worktree bind`, and `caws worktree merge` refuse to mutate a worktree owned by a different session id without `--takeover`. The refusal looks like:

```
Worktree 'wt-foreign' is claimed by 8be65780-...:claude-code
   Last heartbeat: 2026-04-27T17:04:00Z (23 min ago)
   Session log:    tmp/8be65780-72e0-4fc7-a989-4ebac148c18d
                   15 turns, last turn 2026-04-27T17:26:49Z
   To proceed:     caws claim --takeover
```

**Read the session log first.** A stale heartbeat does not mean the prior session is dead — it may be paused. Take over only with explicit user authorization. `--takeover` writes a durable `prior_owners` audit (sessionId, platform, lastSeen-at-takeover, takenOver_at) so postmortems can see what happened.

## Architectural invariants (v11)

These are enforced by code, not docs. Don't try to work around them.

1. `events.jsonl` is written ONLY through the store's `appendEvent`. Never hand-edit.
2. `policy.yaml` owns gate `mode` (block / warn / skip). Waivers filter violations out of the disposition; they do not change gate mode.
3. Doctor is pure (kernel-side). The store composes the snapshot; doctor inspects it.
4. Missing != malformed. Diagnostics distinguish absence from corruption.
5. `events.jsonl` is never required at rest. The first `appendEvent` creates it.
6. `caws init` is idempotent and non-destructive. It refuses legacy residue. There is no `--force`.
7. `caws status` is observability. Running it any number of times produces no `.caws/` byte changes.

## Risk tiers (your quality contract)

| Tier | Contracts | Change-budget posture | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Required | Tightest (smallest `max_files` / `max_loc`) | Auth, billing, migrations |
| **2** | Required | Moderate | Features, APIs, data writes |
| **3** | Optional | Loosest | UI, internal tools |

Set the tier in your spec's `risk_tier` field (integer `1`/`2`/`3`). Tier governs change-budget thresholds (derived from `.caws/policy.yaml` `risk_tiers`) and whether contracts are required. **Coverage and mutation are NOT v11 CAWS gates** — the v10 "90%/80%/70%" coverage table is gone; run coverage/mutation thresholds in your own CI. `caws gates run --spec <id>` evaluates the gates declared in `policy.yaml` (each with a `mode` of block/warn/skip).

## Waivers

Waivers legitimately bypass a gate violation. They do not change gate mode — they filter violations out of the disposition.

```bash
caws waiver create FEAT-1-w \
  --gate budget_limit \
  --reason "Refactor required emergency budget breach; cleanup tracked in FEAT-2" \
  --approved-by "team-lead@example.com" \
  --expires-at "2026-12-01T00:00:00Z"

caws waiver list
caws waiver show FEAT-1-w
caws waiver revoke FEAT-1-w
```

## Reprieves

A **reprieve** skips a PreToolUse guard for exactly one agent session until a stated expiry. It replaces the anti-pattern of commenting a guard out of the dispatcher's HANDLERS array (which disables it for *every* agent, forever, with no reason or expiry). Reprieves are operational cache (gitignored, under the vendor `hooks/state/` dir), not governance state — they do not flow through `events.jsonl` or the kernel.

```bash
caws reprieve grant --current \
  --handlers protected-paths.sh \
  --reason "editing casr-context.sh under CASR-HOOK-LIVE-WIRING-OWNER-STEP-01" \
  --approved-by "darian" \
  --expires-at "2026-07-16T00:00:00Z"

caws reprieve show --current
caws reprieve revoke --current --reason "done editing hooks"
caws reprieve list
```

**Reprieve vs waiver** — different enforcement layers, do not confuse them:
- A **waiver** bypasses a **GATE** at policy-run time (`caws gates run`). It is governance state (`.caws/waivers/`), kernel-adjudicated, optionally scoped to a spec. Use it when a gate's threshold is wrong for a legitimate change.
- A **reprieve** skips a **HOOK guard** at dispatch time (the PreToolUse chain). It is operational cache (vendor `hooks/state/`), session-scoped, expiring. Use it when one session legitimately needs to do what a guard blocks (e.g. editing a hook script) without disabling the guard for every other session.

A reprieve carries a mandatory `--reason`, `--approved-by`, and `--expires-at`. The skip is logged to stderr (`[reprieve] <handler> skipped for session <id> (expires <ts>)`) so the audit trail shows when and why a guard was skipped. A foreign session is never covered — the state file is keyed to the resolved session id.

## Exit codes (uniform across v11)

- `0` — success / observation
- `1` — domain failure (gate failed, doctor finding, scope refused, waiver duplicate)
- `2` — composition failure (not a git repo, can't read `.caws/`, missing required tooling)

## When to ask a human

- **Tier 1 changes** — always request review.
- **Architecture decisions** — when the design affects multiple components or governed paths.
- **Waivers on T1 gates** — emergency only; document mitigation plan.
- **`caws claim --takeover`** — never without explicit authorization.
- **A dangerous-command hook fires** — `block-dangerous.sh` returning `block` or `ask` is a human-review boundary, not a syntax problem to solve. Do not rephrase, wrap, reorder, or alias the command. Stop and ask. The hook also engages a per-session latch that blocks all subsequent Bash until the user runs `reset-danger-latch.sh`. Read [`docs/failure-lineage.md`](docs/failure-lineage.md) Entry 17 for why this rule exists.

## Common pitfalls

**Problem**: Tried to run `caws validate` / `caws iterate` / `caws diagnose` / `caws verify-acs` / `caws evaluate` / `caws burnup`.
**Cause**: Reading a stale doc that pre-dates v11.0 cutover.
**Fix**: Those commands were removed in v11.0 and are not planned to return. Use `caws doctor` (drift / structure) and `caws gates run --spec <id>` (policy / quality) as the validation surface. `caws specs create` was restored in v11.1.

**Problem**: `caws init` refuses to run.
**Cause**: Legacy `.caws/working-spec.yaml` residue from v10.x.
**Fix**: Migrate that file's contents into `.caws/specs/<id>.yaml`, then re-run.

**Problem**: `caws claim` refused with a foreign-owner message.
**Cause**: Another agent session owns the worktree.
**Fix**: Read their session log under `.caws/sessions/<sessionId>/`; only `--takeover` with user authorization.

**Problem**: A gate keeps blocking and you want to bypass it.
**Cause**: Hand-editing `change_budget` will be rejected by CI; the right escape is a waiver.
**Fix**: `caws waiver create` with reason, approver, and expiry.

**Mission**: Deliver reliable, scoped, auditable changes through the v11 governance surface. When the docs and the doctrine doc disagree, trust the doctrine doc.
