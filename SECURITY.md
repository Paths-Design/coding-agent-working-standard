# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

CAWS (Coding Agent Workflow System) prioritizes security through multiple layers of protection, including tool allowlisting, secret detection, provenance tracking, and comprehensive validation. This document outlines our security practices and vulnerability reporting process.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

#### 1. Tool Allowlisting
- Restricted set of approved tools for agents
- Prevents execution of unauthorized commands
- Enforced through prompt linting and runtime checks

#### 2. Secret Detection
- Automated scanning of prompts and generated code
- Pattern-based detection of credentials and sensitive data
- Integration with security scanning tools

#### 3. Provenance Tracking
- Complete audit trail of all operations
- Cryptographic signatures for integrity verification
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation

#### 4. Input Validation
- Schema-based validation of working specifications
- Sanitization of user inputs and project names
- Type-safe operations with TypeScript

#### 5. Supply Chain Security
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts) attestations
- Containerized builds with provenance

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Security Checks
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of credentials and keys
- **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment of dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Security analysis of build environments
- **Code Quality**: ESLint security rules and best practices

### Quality Gates
All changes must pass security validation:
- No high-severity vulnerabilities
- No exposed secrets or credentials
- Compliance with tool allowlists
- Valid provenance manifests

## üìã Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report security issues privately to our security team at:

**Email**: security@caws.dev
**Subject**: [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report

### What to Include in Your Report

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
5. **Environment**: Node.js version, OS, and other relevant details
6. **Proof of Concept**: If available, without exposing sensitive data

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Initial response within 24 hours
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates the report
3. **Confirmation**: Vulnerability confirmed or rejected
4. **Development**: Fix developed and tested
5. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure with reporter
6. **Release**: Security update released

### Response Timeline

- **Critical Issues**: Response within 24 hours, fix within 7 days
- **High Priority**: Response within 48 hours, fix within 14 days
- **Medium Priority**: Response within 72 hours, fix within 30 days
- **Low Priority**: Response within 1 week, fix in next release

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Safe Usage
- Use official CAWS packages from trusted sources
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow security guidelines in documentation
- Report suspicious behavior

#### Configuration Security
- Use strong, unique project identifiers
- Limit blast radius in working specifications
- Set appropriate rollback SLOs
- Enable security scanning in CI/CD

### For Contributors

#### Secure Development
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use the prompt linter for AI-generated code
- Follow tool allowlist restrictions
- Validate all inputs and outputs
- Write security-focused tests

#### Code Review Security
- Review for potential security issues
- Check for proper input validation
- Verify error handling doesn't leak information
- Ensure compliance with security policies

## üö® Security Incident Response

### Incident Detection
- Automated monitoring for suspicious activity
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Community reports and feedback
- Dependency monitoring for vulnerabilities

### Incident Response Team
The security incident response team consists of:
- Core maintainers with security expertise
- External security advisors when needed
- Legal counsel for complex incidents

### Incident Communication
- **Internal**: Secure channels for team coordination
- **External**: Coordinated disclosure to affected parties
- **Public**: Transparent updates when appropriate
- **Regulatory**: Compliance with legal reporting requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools Integration

### Supported Security Tools
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Static security analysis
- **GitLeaks**: Secret detection in repositories
- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Comprehensive security scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Integration Points
- Pre-commit hooks for secret detection
- CI/CD pipeline security gates
