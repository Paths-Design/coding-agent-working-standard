# CAWS - Coding Agent Workflow System

An engineering-grade operating system for coding agents that enforces quality, reliability, and maintainability through automated validation, provenance tracking, and comprehensive tooling.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 10.0.0

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test

# Lint all packages
npm run lint
```

### CLI Usage

#### Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended for CLI usage)
```bash
# Install globally for CLI usage
npm install -g @paths.design/caws-cli

# Initialize a new CAWS project
caws init my-new-project

# Scaffold an existing project
caws scaffold

# Validate working specification
caws validate
```

#### Option 2: Local Development (Monorepo) (Recommended for development)
```bash
# Build and run CLI directly (development)
node packages/caws-cli/dist/index.js --help

# Initialize a new CAWS project
node packages/caws-cli/dist/index.js init my-new-project

# Scaffold CAWS components
node packages/caws-cli/dist/index.js scaffold

# Validate working specification
node packages/caws-cli/dist/index.js validate
```

#### Option 3: npm Scripts (Project Context) (Recommended for project context)
```bash
# From the project root (when working in this monorepo)
node apps/tools/caws/start.js        # Start a new change
node .caws/validate.js .caws/working-spec.yaml  # Validate working spec
npm run caws:verify                  # Run full quality gates
node apps/tools/caws/attest.js > .agent/attestation.json  # Generate attestations
```

**Note**: For scripts that need arguments, use direct node execution rather than npm run.

## Monorepo Structure

This is a Turborepo-managed monorepo with the following packages:

```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ caws-cli/           # CLI tool for scaffolding projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ caws-template/      # Project template with tools and configurations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ caws-test-project/  # Example project using CAWS
```

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Development mode with watch
npm run dev

# Lint all packages
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format

# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Validate CAWS configurations
npm run validate

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

### Package-Specific Scripts

#### CAWS CLI (`@caws/cli`)
```bash
cd packages/caws-cli
npm run build        # Build TypeScript
npm run dev          # Development with watch
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Lint code
npm run format       # Format code
npm run start        # Run CLI
```

#### CAWS Template (`@caws/template`)
```bash
cd packages/caws-template
npm run build        # Build tools
npm run validate     # Validate working spec
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Lint tools
npm run format       # Format code
```

### Adding New Packages

1. Create a new directory in `packages/`
2. Add package.json with name prefixed with `@caws/`
3. Add the package to turbo.json dependencies if needed
4. Add any shared configurations (TypeScript, ESLint, etc.)

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### CAWS CLI
- **Purpose**: Scaffolds new projects and adds CAWS components to existing projects
- **Features**:
  - Interactive project setup with validation
  - Schema-based configuration validation
  - Git repository initialization
  - Provenance tracking and attestation
  - Error handling and recovery

#### CAWS Template
- **Purpose**: Provides the complete CAWS project structure and tools
- **Features**:
  - Working specification schemas
  - Quality gate enforcement tools
  - Provenance and attestation utilities
  - Security scanning and compliance
  - CI/CD pipeline configurations

### Quality Gates

The system enforces multiple quality gates:

1. **Naming Guard**: Prevents shadow file patterns (copy, enhanced, v2, etc.)
2. **Scope Guard**: Ensures changes stay within declared scope
3. **Budget Guard**: Enforces file/line-of-code limits
4. **Schema Validation**: Validates working specifications
5. **Security Scanning**: Detects secrets and validates tool allowlists
6. **Trust Scoring**: Automated quality assessment

### Risk Tiering

Projects are classified into risk tiers with appropriate rigor levels:

- **Tier 1** (Critical): auth/billing/migrations - Maximum rigor
- **Tier 2** (Standard): features/APIs - Standard rigor
- **Tier 3** (Low Risk): UI/tooling - Basic rigor

## Security & Compliance

### Provenance Tracking
- Complete audit trail of all operations
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts) attestations
- Cryptographic signatures for integrity

### Tool Allowlisting
- Restricted set of approved tools for agents
- Security scanning of prompts and outputs
- Secret detection and prevention

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated security analysis (SAST)
- Containerized builds with provenance

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Contract Tests**: API specifications
- **Mutation Tests**: Test effectiveness validation
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance

### Coverage Requirements
- **Tier 1**: ‚â•90% branch coverage, ‚â•70% mutation score
- **Tier 2**: ‚â•80% branch coverage, ‚â•50% mutation score
- **Tier 3**: ‚â•70% branch coverage, ‚â•30% mutation score

## Trust Score

CAWS calculates a trust score (0-100) based on:

- Test coverage and mutation adequacy
- Contract compliance and versioning
- Accessibility and performance compliance
- Observability and rollback readiness
- Mode and scope discipline
- Supply chain attestations

**Target**: ‚â•82/100 for production readiness
