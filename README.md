npm run caws:validate                # Validate working spec (with tools)
npm run caws:verify                  # Run full quality gates
node apps/tools/caws/attest.js > .agent/attestation.json  # Generate attestations

# Dynamic tool management
npm run caws tools list              # List all available tools
npm run caws tools run validate      # Execute specific tool
```

**Note**: For scripts that need arguments, use direct node execution rather than npm run.

## Monorepo Structure

This is a Turborepo-managed monorepo with the following packages:

```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ caws-cli/           # CLI tool for scaffolding projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ caws-template/      # Project template with tools and configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ caws-test-project/  # Example project using CAWS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ caws-mcp-server/    # Model Context Protocol server for agent integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ caws-vscode-extension/ # VS Code extension with real-time CAWS integration
```

## Agent Integration

CAWS provides specialized commands for agents to use as quality bars during iterative development:

### Agent Commands

```bash
# Evaluate work against CAWS quality standards (JSON output for parsing)
caws agent evaluate .caws/working-spec.yaml

# Get iterative development guidance based on current progress
caws agent iterate --current-state '{"description": "Started implementation"}' .caws/working-spec.yaml

# Validate spec readiness without running quality gates
caws agent evaluate --feedback-only .caws/working-spec.yaml
```

### Agent Workflow Integration

Agents can integrate CAWS into their development loops:

```javascript
// Example agent integration
async function developWithCaws(specPath) {
  let currentState = 'Initial implementation';

  while (true) {
    // Evaluate current progress
    const result = await runCommand(`caws agent evaluate ${specPath}`);

    if (result.success && result.evaluation.overall_status === 'quality_passed') {
      console.log('‚úÖ Implementation complete!');
      break;
    }

    // Get guidance for next iteration
    const guidance = await runCommand(
      `caws agent iterate --current-state '{"description": "${currentState}"}' ${specPath}`
    );

    // Execute recommended next steps
    await implementSteps(guidance.iteration.next_steps);

    currentState = `Completed: ${guidance.iteration.next_steps.join(', ')}`;
  }
}
```

### Quality Standards

CAWS enforces risk-tiered quality standards:

- **Tier 1** (High Risk): 90% coverage, 70% mutation, contracts required
- **Tier 2** (Medium Risk): 80% coverage, 50% mutation, contracts required
- **Tier 3** (Low Risk): 70% coverage, 30% mutation, contracts optional

Agents receive structured feedback on failing criteria with actionable improvement suggestions.

See [`docs/agent-integration-guide.md`](docs/agent-integration-guide.md) for comprehensive agent integration documentation.

## Waivers System

CAWS provides a waivers system for exceptional circumstances where quality gates need to be temporarily bypassed. Waivers are fully auditable and flagged for review.

### Waiver Creation

```bash
caws waivers create \
  --title "Emergency security fix" \
  --reason emergency_hotfix \
  --description "Critical vulnerability fix requiring immediate deployment" \
  --gates coverage_threshold,contract_compliance \
  --expires-at "2025-11-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --approved-by "security-team" \
  --impact-level critical \
  --mitigation-plan "Manual security testing completed, automated tests temporarily waived"
```

### Waiver Management

```bash
# List active waivers
caws waivers list

# Revoke a waiver
caws waivers revoke WV-0001 --reason "Issue resolved"

# Extend waiver expiration
caws waivers extend WV-0001 --new-expiry "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z" --approved-by "security-team"

# Waiver statistics
caws waivers stats
```

### Waiver Features

- **Risk Assessment**: Required impact level and mitigation plan
- **Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of expired waivers
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of waiver lifecycle
- **Review Flagging**: High-risk waivers create review files for code owners
- **Context Awareness**: Environment-specific waiver application

## Experimental Mode

CAWS experimental mode provides access to cutting-edge features with built-in safety measures.

### Dry Run Support

```bash
# Dry run validation without side effects
caws experimental --dry-run validate .caws/working-spec.yaml --enhanced-analysis

# Dry run quality gates
caws experimental --dry-run quality-gates .caws/working-spec.yaml --parallel-execution
```

### Experimental Features

- **Enhanced Analysis**: Advanced spec validation with AI assistance
- **Predictive Scoring**: ML-based quality predictions

- **Smart Selection**: AI-powered test selection algorithms

## CI/CD Optimization

CAWS provides intelligent CI/CD pipeline optimization based on project risk tier and characteristics.

### Pipeline Analysis

```bash
# Analyze project for optimization opportunities
caws cicd analyze

# Example output:
# üìä Project Tier: 2
# ‚è±Ô∏è  Estimated Savings: 64% faster builds
# üí∞ Monthly Time Savings: 8 hours
```

### Configuration Generation

```bash
# Generate optimized GitHub Actions workflow
caws cicd generate github --output .github/workflows/caws-gates.yml

# Generate GitLab CI configuration
caws cicd generate gitlab --output .gitlab-ci.yml

```javascript
class MyTool extends BaseTool {
  getMetadata() {
    return {
      id: 'my-tool',
      name: 'My Custom Tool',
      version: '1.0.0',
      capabilities: ['validation'],
      author: 'Your Name',
    };
  }

  async executeImpl(parameters, context) {
    // Tool implementation
    return { success: true, output: result };
  }
}
```

### Risk Tiering

Projects are classified into risk tiers with appropriate rigor levels:

- **Tier 1** (Critical): auth/billing/migrations - Maximum rigor
- **Tier 2** (Standard): features/APIs - Standard rigor
- **Tier 3** (Low Risk): UI/tooling - Basic rigor

## Security & Compliance

### Provenance Tracking
