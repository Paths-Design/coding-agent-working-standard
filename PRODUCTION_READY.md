## Structured Logging Highlights

### Before

```javascript
console.error('MCP Initialize: protocol=1.0, client=cursor');
console.log('✅ CAWS monitoring system active');
```

### After

```javascript
logger.info({ protocolVersion, client: clientInfo?.name }, 'MCP initialization');
logger.info('CAWS monitoring system active');
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Structured JSON output for log aggregation
- ✅ Configurable log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
- ✅ Pretty-printed development output
- ✅ Production-ready JSON logs
- ✅ Contextual metadata in all messages
- ✅ Zero performance overhead

---

## Release Process

### Automated via semantic-release

When committed and pushed to main with conventional commits, semantic-release will:

1. ✅ Analyze commits for version bump
2. ✅ Generate CHANGELOG.md
3. ✅ Update package.json version
4. ✅ Create git tag
5. ✅ Publish to npm with SLSA provenance
6. ✅ Create GitHub release
