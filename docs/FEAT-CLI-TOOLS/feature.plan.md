# Implement dynamic CLI tools integration and plugin system

## Overview
Enable the CAWS CLI to dynamically discover, load, and execute tools from `apps/tools/caws/` directory as an integrated plugin system. This transforms standalone scripts into a cohesive quality gate and development workflow system.

Business Value: Eliminates manual tool execution, provides unified CLI experience, enables real-time quality validation, and creates extensible architecture for future tools.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Tool Discovery**: CLI automatically detects tools in `apps/tools/caws/` during setup
- **Dynamic Loading**: Tools are loaded as Node.js modules with proper error handling
- **Security Validation**: All tools validated against allowlist before execution
- **Quality Gate Integration**: Tools executed automatically during `caws validate` and `caws verify`
- **Command Registration**: Tools can register new CLI commands dynamically
- **Configuration Management**: Tools can access shared configuration and working specs

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Tool discovery < 500ms, tool loading < 200ms
- **Security**: No arbitrary code execution, safe module loading
- **Reliability**: Tools failing doesn't break CLI, graceful degradation
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools without CLI changes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Tool Discovery & Loading (Files: 3, LOC: ~150)
1. Create `ToolLoader` class in `packages/caws-cli/src/tool-loader.js`
2. Implement tool discovery logic with filesystem scanning
3. Add module loading with validation and error handling
4. Integrate tool loader into CLI setup detection

### Phase 2: Security & Validation (Files: 2, LOC: ~100)
1. Create tool validation against allowlist (`tools-allow.json`)
2. Implement sandboxed execution environment
3. Add security scanning for tool code
4. Create tool manifest validation

### Phase 3: CLI Integration (Files: 4, LOC: ~250)
1. Modify CLI commands to use loaded tools
2. Update `validate` command to run tool-based quality gates
3. Add new `tools` command for tool management
4. Integrate observability and metrics collection

### Phase 4: Tool API & Contracts (Files: 3, LOC: ~150)
1. Define tool interface contract (`ITool`)
2. Create base tool class with common functionality
3. Update existing tools to implement new interface
4. Add tool registration and lifecycle management

## Blast Radius
- **Modules**: caws-cli (core), existing tools in apps/tools/caws/
- **Data migration**: No - this is additive functionality
- **Cross-service contracts**: CLI API contract updates for tool integration

## Operational Rollback SLO
- **5 minutes**: Disable via environment variable `CAWS_TOOLS_ENABLED=false`
- **15 minutes**: Remove tools directory or rename to disable discovery
- **1 hour**: Rollback CLI package to previous version

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Tool discovery and loading logic
- Security validation functions
- Tool interface compliance
- Error handling and recovery

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end CLI commands with tools
- Tool execution in different scenarios
- Security violation detection
- Performance benchmarking

### Contract Tests
- Tool interface compliance
- CLI API contract validation
- Tool manifest schema validation

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: 80% of CAWS projects use dynamic tools within 3 months
- **Performance**: Tool discovery < 500ms, CLI startup < 2s
- **Security**: Zero security incidents from tool loading
- **Reliability**: < 1% tool loading failures in production
- **Developer Experience**: 50% reduction in manual tool execution commands
