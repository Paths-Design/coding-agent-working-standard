**Status**: Production Ready

## Overview

This document provides procedures for rolling back bad releases and responding to production incidents for CAWS packages.

---

## Quick Reference

| Scenario                   | Action             | Time to Resolution |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Broken npm package**     | Deprecate + hotfix | 15-30 minutes      |
| **Security vulnerability** | Emergency patch    | 1-4 hours          |
| **Failed CI/CD**           | Revert commit      | 5-10 minutes       |
| **Breaking API change**    | Major version bump | N/A - by design    |

---

## Rollback Strategies

### Strategy 1: npm Deprecation (Recommended)

**When to use**: Broken release discovered after users have installed

**Advantages**:

- Doesn't break existing installations
- Users get warning on new installs
- Can still install if explicitly needed

**Procedure**:

```bash
# 1. Identify broken version
npm view @paths.design/caws-cli versions

# 2. Deprecate the broken version
npm deprecate @paths.design/caws-cli@3.4.1 "Known issue: validation fails on Windows. Use 3.4.0 or wait for 3.4.2"

# 3. Verify deprecation
npm view @paths.design/caws-cli

# 4. Notify users via GitHub Release notes
gh release edit v3.4.1 --notes "‚ö†Ô∏è This release has been deprecated. Use 3.4.0 or wait for 3.4.2"

# 5. Prepare hotfix
git checkout main
git revert <bad-commit>
# semantic-release will auto-publish 3.4.2
```

**User Impact**: Low - existing installations work, new users warned

---

### Strategy 2: Hotfix Release (Fastest)

**When to use**: Critical bug or security issue

**Advantages**:

- Fastest resolution
- Users get fix automatically on update
- Maintains version history

**Procedure**:

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch (optional, can work on main)
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Fix the issue
# ... make code changes ...

# 3. Write fix commit with semantic-release format
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical validation bug

This fixes the Windows path handling issue introduced in 3.4.1

Fixes #123"

# 4. Push to main
git push origin main

# 5. CI automatically:
#    - Runs tests
#    - Creates 3.4.2 release
#    - Publishes to npm
#    - Creates GitHub release

# 6. Verify release
npm view @paths.design/caws-cli version
# Should show 3.4.2

# 7. Optional: Deprecate bad version
npm deprecate @paths.design/caws-cli@3.4.1 "Fixed in 3.4.2"
```

**User Impact**: Low - users update to fixed version

**Timeline**: 15-30 minutes (including CI/CD)

---

### Strategy 3: npm Unpublish (Emergency Only)

**When to use**: Critical security issue + package published <72 hours ago

**Disadvantages**:

- Breaks anyone who installed it
- Only works within 72 hours
- Creates gaps in version history

**Procedure**:

```bash
# 1. Confirm timing (must be <72 hours)
npm view @paths.design/caws-cli time

# 2. Unpublish the version
npm unpublish @paths.design/caws-cli@3.4.1

# 3. Verify removal
npm view @paths.design/caws-cli versions
# 3.4.1 should be missing

# 4. Publish fixed version
git revert <bad-commit>
git commit -m "fix: security patch"
git push
# CI publishes 3.4.2

# 5. Notify users who may have installed
gh issue create --title "SECURITY: Upgrade from 3.4.1 immediately" \
  --body "Version 3.4.1 has been unpublished due to security issue. Upgrade to 3.4.2."
```

**User Impact**: HIGH - breaks existing installations

**Use only for**: Critical security vulnerabilities

---

### Strategy 4: Major Version Rollback

**When to use**: Breaking changes need to be reverted

**Procedure**:

```bash
# If v4.0.0 introduced breaking changes that need rollback

# 1. Don't unpublish major versions
# 2. Document why v4.x is problematic
# 3. Continue supporting v3.x

# 4. Publish clarification
npm dist-tag add @paths.design/caws-cli@3.9.0 latest

# This makes 3.9.0 the default install again
# Users on v4.x can stay, but new installs get v3.x

# 5. Announce via GitHub
gh release create v3.9.1 --notes "LTS release. v4.x is not recommended yet."
```

## Incident Response Playbook

### Severity Levels

| Level             | Description                      | Response Time | Example                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **P0 - Critical** | Production down, security breach | <1 hour       | Remote code execution vulnerability |
| **P1 - High**     | Major functionality broken       | <4 hours      | CLI crashes on all platforms        |
| **P2 - Medium**   | Functionality degraded           | <24 hours     | Feature broken on Windows only      |

**Response**:

```bash
# === IMMEDIATE (0-15 minutes) ===

# 1. Assess impact
# - How many users affected?
# - What versions affected?
# - What's the attack vector?

# 2. If security issue: Disable if possible
# Option A: Deprecate immediately
npm deprecate @paths.design/caws-cli@3.4.1 "CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - DO NOT USE"

# Option B: Unpublish (if <72h)
npm unpublish @paths.design/caws-cli@3.4.1

## Verification Procedures

### Pre-Rollback Checks

```bash
# 1. Identify scope of issue
npm view @paths.design/caws-cli time
# When was bad version published?

npm view @paths.design/caws-cli downloads
# How many downloads?

# 2. Check dependencies
npm view @paths.design/caws-cli dependencies
# Will rollback affect other packages?

# 3. Review open issues
gh issue list --label "bug"
# Are there related issues?
```

### Post-Rollback Verification

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback-verification.sh

set -e

echo "üîç Verifying rollback..."

# 1. Check npm package
LATEST=$(npm view @paths.design/caws-cli version)
echo "Latest version on npm: $LATEST"

# 2. Test fresh install
echo "Testing fresh install..."
docker run --rm node:22-alpine sh -c "
  npm install -g @paths.design/caws-cli@$LATEST
  caws --version
  caws validate --help
"

# 3. Run smoke tests
echo "Running smoke tests..."
npm run test:e2e:smoke

# 4. Check GitHub release
echo "Verifying GitHub release..."
gh release view v$LATEST

echo "‚úÖ Rollback verification complete"
```
