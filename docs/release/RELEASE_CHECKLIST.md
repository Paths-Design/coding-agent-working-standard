## üöÄ Release Process

### Step 1: Pre-Release Verification

```bash
# Run release verification script
node scripts/release-check.mjs

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ All package versions verified
# ‚úÖ All build outputs exist
# ‚úÖ Waiver integration working
```

### Step 2: Final Testing

```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test

# Run quality gates
node packages/quality-gates/run-quality-gates.mjs --gates=all

# Run CAWS validation
caws validate

# Run CAWS diagnosis
caws diagnose
```

### Step 3: Build All Packages

```bash
# Clean build
npm run clean
npm run build

# Verify builds
ls -la packages/caws-cli/dist/
ls -la packages/caws-mcp-server/
ls -la packages/caws-vscode-extension/out/
```

### Step 4: Version Check

```bash
# Verify versions are correct
cat packages/caws-cli/package.json | grep version
cat packages/caws-mcp-server/package.json | grep version
cat packages/caws-vscode-extension/package.json | grep version
```

### Step 5: Git Preparation

```bash
# Ensure all changes committed
git status

# Verify commit messages follow conventional commits
git log --oneline -5

# Ensure working directory clean
git diff --exit-code
```

### Step 6: Release Execution

**Option A: Automated Semantic Release (Recommended)**

```bash
# Push to main triggers semantic-release
git push origin main

# Monitor CI/CD for release
# Check GitHub Actions: Release workflow
```

**Option B: Manual Release**

```bash
# Publish CLI
cd packages/caws-cli
npm publish

# Publish MCP Server
cd ../caws-mcp-server
npm publish

# Package Extension (for VS Code Marketplace)
cd ../caws-vscode-extension
npm run package
# Then manually upload to VS Code Marketplace
```

### Step 7: Post-Release Verification

  - [ ] CLI available: `npm view @paths.design/caws-cli version`
  - [ ] MCP server available: `npm view caws-mcp-server version`
  - [ ] Extension version updated in marketplace

- [ ] **Installation Test**: Test fresh install

  ```bash
  npm install -g @paths.design/caws-cli@latest
  caws --version
  ```

- [ ] **Git Tag**: Release tag created

  ```bash
  git tag -l | tail -5
  ```

- [ ] **GitHub Release**: Release notes published

## üêõ Known Issues & Gaps

### Current Process Gaps

1. **Waiver Active File Sync**: `caws waivers create` doesn't automatically update `active-waivers.yaml`
   - **Impact**: Manual sync required for quality gates integration
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Status**: Temporary workaround in place

2. **Extension Packaging**: VS Code extension has template dependency issues
   - **Impact**: Extension not published in v4.1.0
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Status**: Requires investigation

3. **CI/CD Test Coverage**: Some test scripts have fallback warnings
   - **Impact**: Tests may silently skip
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Status**: Acceptable for now

4. **Pre-Commit Hook Dependencies**: Some hooks reference scripts that may not exist
   - **Impact**: Hooks may fail silently
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Status**: Needs verification

### Process Improvements Needed

1. **Automated Waiver Sync**: Implement automatic `active-waivers.yaml` update
2. **Pre-Release Smoke Tests**: Add automated pre-release smoke test suite
3. **Release Verification**: Enhance `release-check.mjs` with more checks
4. **Hook Testing**: Add tests for git hooks themselves
5. **CI/CD Parallelization**: Optimize CI/CD workflow execution time
6. **Dry-Run Everything**: Add dry-run mode for all release steps
