# AI Agent Developer Experience Improvements

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0.1 → 2.0.2  
**Author:** @darianrosebrook

## Executive Summary

This document outlines critical improvements made to the CAWS CLI to support AI agent workflows. The original implementation had several issues that prevented AI agents from successfully using the tool, leading to a poor developer experience.

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. ❌ Missing Template Directory (Critical)

**Issue:** When installed via `npm install -g @paths.design/caws-cli`, the CLI could not find template files.

**Error:**
```
❌ No template directory available!
❌ No .caws directory found
💡 Run "caws init <project-name>" first to create a CAWS project
```

**Root Cause:**
- Templates were in a separate `@caws/template` package
- The `@caws/template` dependency was removed (as it wasn't published to npm)
- Templates were NOT bundled with the CLI package
- The CLI only looked for templates in monorepo/development paths

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** Critical
- **User Impact:** 100% failure rate for npm-installed CLI
- **Affects:** All users installing from npm (production use case)

---

### 2. 🤖 Interactive Prompts Hanging

**Issue:** AI agents cannot provide real-time input to interactive prompts.

**Example:**
```
? 📋 Project ID (e.g., FEAT-1234, AUTH-456): (DESIGNER-001) 
The command was interrupted.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Default behavior was interactive mode
- AI agents have no mechanism to respond to stdin prompts
- No clear documentation on non-interactive usage

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** High
- **User Impact:** AI agents must interrupt or manually bypass
- **Workaround:** Required knowledge of `--non-interactive` flag

---

### 3. 📚 Confusing Workflow

**Issue:** Unclear relationship between `init` and `scaffold` commands.

**Problem Sequence:**
1. Agent sees existing project
2. Runs `caws scaffold` (seems logical)
3. Gets error: "No .caws directory found"
4. Must figure out to run `init` first

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **User Impact:** Workflow confusion, trial-and-error required
- **Documentation:** Insufficient guidance for AI agents

---

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Solution 1: Bundle Templates with CLI

**Changes Made:**

1. **Copy templates into CLI package:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p packages/caws-cli/templates
   cp -r packages/caws-template/* packages/caws-cli/templates/
   ```

2. **Update `package.json` to include templates:**
   ```json
   "files": [
     "dist",
     "README.md",
     "templates"
   ]
   ```

3. **Update template detection in `src/index.js`:**
   ```javascript
   const possibleTemplatePaths = [
     // FIRST: Try bundled templates (for npm-installed CLI)
     path.resolve(__dirname, '../templates'),
     path.resolve(__dirname, 'templates'),
     // ... other fallbacks
   ];
   ```

**Results:**
- ✅ Templates available after npm install
- ✅ No external dependencies needed
- ✅ Package size: 552KB (acceptable)
- ✅ Works in all environments

**Before/After:**
```
Before: 8 files, 70.7 KB
After:  57 files, 552.1 KB
```

### ✅ Solution 2: Improve Non-Interactive Mode

**Status:** Already implemented, just needed documentation

**Existing Features:**
- `--non-interactive` or `-n` flag
- Sensible defaults for all prompts
- Compatible with AI agents

**Added:**
- Comprehensive AI agent guide
- Clear documentation of flag behavior
- Example workflows

---

### ✅ Solution 3: Create AI Agent Documentation

**Created Documentation:**
- AI agent usage guide
- Test environment setup
- Example workflows and troubleshooting

**Key Sections:**
1. Quick start commands
2. Common workflows
3. Key flags for AI agents
4. Troubleshooting guide
5. Best practices

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Test Environment

Created comprehensive test environment at `/tmp/caws-agent-test/`:
- `goal.md` - Project requirements
- `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide
- `README.md` - Test documentation

### ✅ Successful Test Run

```bash
cd /tmp/caws-agent-test
caws init todo-app --non-interactive
```

**Results:**
- ✅ No template errors
- ✅ No interactive prompts
- ✅ Clean success message
- ✅ All expected files created
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Provenance tracking working

**Output:**
```
✅ Schema validation initialized successfully
🚀 Initializing new CAWS project: todo-app
📁 Created project directory: todo-app
✅ Generated working spec passed validation
✅ Found template directory: /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@paths.design/caws-cli/templates
✅ Provenance saved to .agent/provenance.json
🎉 Project initialized successfully!
```

## Recommended AI Agent Workflow

### For New Projects:
```bash
# 1. Initialize with CAWS
caws init my-project --non-interactive

# 2. Navigate to project
cd my-project

# 3. Set up development environment
npm init -y
npm install <dependencies>

# 4. Start coding
```

**What gets created:**
- `.caws/working-spec.yaml` - Project specification
- `.agent/provenance.json` - Agent provenance tracking
- `agents.md` or `caws.md` - CAWS guide for AI agents
- `.git/` - Git repository (if `--no-git` not specified)

### For Existing Projects:
```bash
# 1. Add CAWS to existing project
cd existing-project
caws init . --non-interactive --no-git

# 2. Continue development with CAWS tracking
```

**Conflict Resolution:**
- If `agents.md` exists: CAWS guide is saved as `caws.md` (non-interactive)
- If both exist: Guide copy is skipped
- Interactive mode: Prompts to overwrite `agents.md`

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Bundle Everything Needed
Don't rely on external packages that aren't published. Bundle templates and resources directly.

### 2. AI Agents Need Non-Interactive Mode
Always provide a `--non-interactive` flag with sensible defaults for any CLI tool that might be used by AI agents.

### 3. Documentation Is Critical
AI agents need clear, step-by-step documentation. Include:
- Common workflows
- Troubleshooting
- Expected outputs
- Error messages and solutions

### 4. Test the Published Package
The development environment (monorepo) behaves differently from the published npm package. Always test:
```bash
npm pack
npm install -g ./package.tgz
# Test all commands
```

### 5. Fail-Fast with Clear Messages
When something goes wrong, provide:
- Clear error message
- Explanation of what failed
- Specific solution (not just "check your config")

---

## Future Improvements

### 1. Improve Scaffold Command
Make `scaffold` work without requiring `init` first by detecting the context better.

### 2. Add CI Test
Add automated test that installs from tarball and runs complete agent workflow.

### 3. Add Opt-in Telemetry
Track AI agent usage patterns to identify pain points and improve UX.

### 4. Create Video Tutorial
Record screencasts showing AI agents successfully using CAWS.

### 5. Add More Examples
Create example projects in different languages (Python, Go, Rust, etc.).

## Summary

The CAWS CLI now provides a first-class experience for AI agents:

✅ **Works out of the box** after npm install  
✅ **No interactive prompts** when using `--non-interactive`  
✅ **Clear documentation** for AI agent workflows  
✅ **Comprehensive test environment** for validation  
✅ **Production-ready** for AI-assisted development  

These improvements transform CAWS from "doesn't work for AI agents" to "AI agent-first design."
